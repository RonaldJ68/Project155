    <h1>ABOUT: Admin_Tools</h1>

    <p><strong>Admin_Tools,</strong> is a place that I feel may be useful to future IT Technicians. It contains Links to Administrative  
    tools that has helped me along my IT path. I wanted to create a place, where the tools that I use can be easily accessed from anywhere, 
    anytime.  As I gain the experience of uing more tools I will be upading this site with the tools that I come across in the coming
    future. I hope that it can help you out as well. I have created a "Comments" area for you administrators to leave a link to the tools
    they have also used. so please feel free to leave a link. I will go through the links suggested, for system compatibility and functionality.</p>
