        <p><strong>Windows Tools</strong> can help you with everyday tasks, you will find that not 
        all the tools are the same. Yes, the look a lot alike but not every tool works the same
        either. As an Administrator or, Technician you will try many tools that either will work for you
        and alot that won't. I have put together links that that may or may not help you along you IT path.</p><br/>

        <p><strong>Linex Tools</strong> can help you with everyday tasks, you will find that not 
        all the tools are the same. Yes, the look a lot alike but not every tool works the same
        either. As an Administrator or, Technician you will try many tools that either will work for you
        and alot that won't. I have put together links that that may or may not help you along you IT path</p>

        <a href="ad_index.html"><Img src="Security.jpeg" alt="Security"/>

        <p><Strong>Security</Strong> is one off the most important things to consider when securing a 
        Web page, Network, Cliant, or Server. Security Tools can make the job easier to identify security
        weak spots no matter how small. The following links will lead you to tools that I myself have used 
        in the past, and I have found them to be very reliable and easy to use</p><br/>


        <a href="ad_index.html"><Img src="Forensics.jpeg" alt="Forensics"/><br/>

        <p><strong>Forensics</strong> tools are the only way to find the things that are not meant to found 
        by just anybody, with the right Forensics tools at your disposal nothing is hidden, nothing is safe
        from prying eyes.  So I have come added links to the tools that I have Used in the past and still 
        use to day, when coming accross used hard drives.</p>
